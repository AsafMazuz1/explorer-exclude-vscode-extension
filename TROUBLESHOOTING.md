`Nothing Shows Up After Update`
---

This can happen if you had the extension installed before.  To fix this:

1. Switch to `Extensions` in Left Column
2. Look for `Explorer Exclude`
3. Check to see if it has a `Reload Required` button, it if does, click it ( extension will not work until you do )

If that was not the case, you may need:

1. Uninstall `Explorer Exclude` Extension
2. Restart VS Code
3. Reinstall `Explorer Exclude` Extension

`Unable to install Extension`
---

If you are getting an error like this one:

```
Unable to install Extension 'sfccdevops.explorer-exclude-vscode-extension-1.3.0' as it is not compatible with Code '1.26.0'.
```

It is because you downloaded the Extension from the VS Code Marketplace Website manually ( and not through VS Code's internal extension listing ) and tried to install it into an older, unsupported version of VS Code.

This extension requires VS Code v1.60 or newer.  If you would like to install this extension, you will need to [update VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to version v1.60 or newer.
